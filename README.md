# Vivado State Machine Project:
#### All codes have been tested and simulated at Vivado, all functions operates well when implemented into FPGA board. 

#### The Project includes three parts:

## Part1: Store Switch Inputs 
Input is a 10-bit binary number, provided via ten switches (each representing one bit).We Store this 10-bit number in a 10-bit shift register.
The register will only update its storage after pressing reset button.

## Part2: Clock Divider

## Part3: State Machine
