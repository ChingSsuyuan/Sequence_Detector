# Vivado State Machine Project:
#### All codes have been tested and simulated at Vivado, all functions operates well when implemented into FPGA board. 

#### The Project includes three parts:

## Part1: Store Switch Inputs 
[Path to store_switch_inputs](https://github.com/ChingSsuyuan/Vivado_State_Machine_Project/tree/b22e3189d2a9c86b28a2b5034b8b4f27e8412d79/Store%20Inputs%20Codes)
## Part2: Clock Divider

## Part3: State Machine
