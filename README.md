# Vivado State Machine Project:
#### All codes have been tested and simulated at Vivado, all functions operates well when implemented into FPGA board. 

#### The Project includes three parts:

## [Part1: Store Switch Inputs ](https://github.com/ChingSsuyuan/Vivado_State_Machine_Project/tree/b22e3189d2a9c86b28a2b5034b8b4f27e8412d79/Store%20Inputs%20Codes)
Input is a 10-bit binary number, provided via ten switches (each representing one bit). We Store this 10-bit number in a 10-bit shift register.
The register will only update its storage after pressing reset button.

## [Part2: Clock Divider ](https://github.com/ChingSsuyuan/Vivado_State_Machine_Project/tree/8c4b00b59ab98193503395b9d9de03b9d6740b0d/Clock%20Divider)
Change clock cycle from 100MHZ to 1Hz, slow down the clock to implement seven segements display in 1 Instruction/Second

## Part3: [State Machine](https://github.com/ChingSsuyuan/Vivado_State_Machine_Project/tree/84dd13d7e2cc8164f7c00bf325b66cfc1ece1cd0/Top%20Module)
